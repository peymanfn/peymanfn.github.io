                        <h3>The Effect of changing the Medicare Eligibility Age on the Health of the Near-Retirement Population</h3>
                    </div>
                        <p>Raising the eligibility age for Medicare, the third largest program in the federal budget, could lead to a large reduction in the federal budget deficit; however, the effect of this change on the health of the near-retirement population is unclear. Using
                        Health and Retirement Study (HRS) dataset, I measure the effect of a change in
                        Medicare eligibility age on the health of the elderly population by estimating a dynamic
                        discrete choice model of health and retirement that endogenizes the health investment
                        decisions. Using Forward Simulation and Conditional Choice Probability estimator
                        (CCP), I incorporate a large, multidimensional state space consisting fixed, unobserved
                        heterogeneity that helps me to employ a detailed model to address the health and
                        welfare concerns of the change in the eligibility age of the Medicare. I find that labor
                        supply, life expectancy, and mental health will be affected positively in response to an
                        increase in the Medicare eligibility age. The welfare effect, however, is negative and
                        there is some evidence of cost transfers from Medicare to the Social Security Program...</p>

            <p><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> The findings of this research provide crucial insights for policymakers considering changes in Medicare eligibility age. By understanding the positive effects on labor supply, life expectancy, and mental health, policymakers can make informed decisions to balance budgetary considerations with the well-being of the near-retirement population.</p>
            <p><strong>Value to Private Industries:</strong> Private industries in healthcare can benefit from understanding the potential impacts of changes in Medicare eligibility age. This research offers valuable information for health-related businesses to anticipate shifts in demand and tailor their services accordingly.</p>

                        <h3>Labor Unions and Covid-19: Beyond the Workplace</h3>
                    </div>
                        <p>Person-to-person transmission in the workplace is thought to play a crucial role in the spread of COVID-19.
                            Labor unions are among the largest institutions in the United States, and their role in regulating employee-employer relations is hard to ignore. Costly efforts to contain the virus combined with the monopoly and collective voice faces of unions emphasize the role of unions in shaping the workforceâ€™s response
                            to the pandemic, where the effects can be amplified by the further transmission of the virus beyond the workplace. We utilize state-level data and a dynamic spatial probability model to quantify the
                            total effect of both economic activities and union membership. We find that increasing economic activity by recruiting 1,000 new employees from unemployed
                            individuals would lead to 368 more COVID-19 cases by November 2020 and before the vaccine rollout. However, increasing the union size by 1,000 while keeping
                            the employment level constant would lead to 111 fewer COVID-19 cases in the same period... <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4070080">Paper</a></p>

            <p><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> This research highlights the potential role of labor unions in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Policymakers can leverage this information to formulate strategies that involve unions in the overall public health response, extending the benefits beyond the workplace and contributing to community well-being.</p>
                        <p><strong>Value to Private Industries:</strong> Industries with a focus on workforce management can use this research to understand the impact of union size on COVID-19 cases. Implementing measures to collaborate with unions for safer work environments can be a valuable strategy for private industries to protect their employees and maintain business continuity.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This paper provides a measure of the physical health for the near retirement people based on the binary responses of individuals to the sets of questions...
                    Using three sets of questions: Activities of daily living (ADL), Lower Body Mobility (LBM) and Upper Body Agility (UBA), I employ the Item Response Theory and using Bayesian approach estimate the
                    individual distribution of health for each individual in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) sample of 2008. The Analysis of 17,217 sets of individual responses shows that LBM and UBA affect the combined
                    health index (Full Index) more strongly and ADL has a weak effect on the health index. While the correlation between the full measure of functional limitation and LBM and UBA is 0.92 and 0.84 respectively,
                    the correlation between functional limitation and ADL is only 0.5...</p>

        <p><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> The application of Bayesian approach and Item Response Theory in measuring health in HRS dataset provides a robust method for policymakers to assess physical health in near-retirement populations. This method allows for a more nuanced understanding of health based on specific sets of questions, enabling targeted health interventions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Value to Private Industries:</strong> Industries involved in health assessments and interventions can benefit from the advanced measurement techniques presented in this research. Implementing similar Bayesian approaches can enhance the accuracy of health assessments, providing valuable information for private companies engaged in health-related services.</p>
