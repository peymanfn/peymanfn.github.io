                    <p>Welcome to my Personal website. I am an Economist with a keen interest in diverse policy analyses and econometric methods. While my
                        primary focus lies in Health Economics, I also find excitement in exploring questions related to
                        labor, retirement, gender disparities, and education. My approach to methods is flexible,
                        adapting to the specific needs of each inquiry. This has led me to employ various techniques such
                        as Structural estimation, causal analysis, Bayesian methods, and more.</p>

                    <h3>The Effect of changing the Medicare Eligibility Age on
                        the Health of the Near-Retirement Population</h3>

                        <p>Raising the eligibility age for Medicare, the third largest program in the federal budget,
                            could lead to a large reduction in the federal budget deficit; however, the effect of this
                            change on the health of the near-retirement population is unclear. Using Health and
                            Retirement Study (HRS) dataset, I measure the effect of a change in Medicare eligibility
                            age on the health of the elderly population by estimating a dynamic discrete choice model
                            of health and retirement that endogenizes the health investment decisions. Using Forward
                            Simulation and Conditional Choice Probability estimator (CCP), I incorporate a large,
                            multidimensional state space consisting fixed, unobserved heterogeneity that helps me to
                            employ a detailed model to address the health and welfare concerns of the change in the
                            eligibility age of the Medicare. I find that labor supply, life expectancy, and mental
                            health will be affected positively in response to an increase in the Medicare eligibility
                            age. The welfare effect, however, is negative and there is some evidence of cost transfers
                            from Medicare to the Social Security Program.</p>

                        <p>Person-to-person transmission in the workplace is thought to play a crucial role in the spread
                            of COVID-19. Labor unions are among the largest institutions in the United States, and
                            their role in regulating employee-employer relations is hard to ignore. Costly efforts to
                            contain the virus combined with the monopoly and collective voice faces of unions emphasize
                            the role of unions in shaping the workforceâ€™s response to the pandemic, where the effects
                            can be amplified by the further transmission of the virus beyond the workplace. We utilize
                            state-level data and a dynamic spatial probability model to quantify the total effect of
                            both economic activities and union membership. We find that increasing economic activity by
                            recruiting 1,000 new employees from unemployed individuals would lead to 368 more COVID-19
                            cases by November 2020 and before the vaccine rollout. However, increasing the union size by
                            1,000 while keeping the employment level constant would lead to 111 fewer COVID-19 cases in
                            the same period. <a

                        <p>This paper provides a measure of the physical health for the near retirement people based on
                            the binary responses of individuals to the sets of questions, regarding the objective
                            aspects of their health. Using three sets of questions: Activities of daily living (ADL),
                            Lower Body Mobility (LBM) and Upper Body Agility (UBA), I employ the Item Response Theory
                            and using Bayesian approach estimate the individual distribution of health for each
                            individual in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) sample of 2008. The Analysis of 17,217
                            sets of individual responses shows that LBM and UBA affect the combined health index
                            (Full Index) more strongly and ADL has a weak effect on the health index. While the
                            correlation between the full measure of functional limitation and LBM and UBA is 0.92 and
                            0.84 respectively, the correlation between functional limitation and ADL is only 0.5. </p>
